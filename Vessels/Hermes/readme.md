# Hermes-series Communications satellites
*The second series of automatically launched spacecrafts from the KSC and the first series sporting the brand new OS, aptly named OS2.*

## The Launch Vehicle
The Launch Vehicle is a slightly modified and modernized version of the Continuator launcher with greater range (the orbital stage could possibly bring a small payload on a roundtrip to the Mun).

### Changes from Continuator Launch Vehicle
  * The Hermes-series Launch Vehicle only has three solid fuel boosters in the first stage as opposed to the Continuator-series Launch Vehicle which had four.
  * Every stage on the Hermes-series Launch Vehicle is outfitted with auto-deploying parachutes in order to make the launcher completely recoverable from Low Kerbin Orbit.
  * The third stage, or the orbital stage, has exchanged the quite oversized LV-T30 Reliant LF-engine for the smaller, lighter, and weaker LV-909 Terrier LF-engine.
  * The boosters on the first stage has been outfitted with small retrorockets that will make sure the boosters separate cleanly from the second stage.
  * Since the whole Launch Vehicle is designed to be recoverable the per-launch cost will be lower than the cost listed in the table below.
  * Our engineers estimate that up to ~$6200 can be shaved off the per-launch cost if recovery of dropped stages is successful
